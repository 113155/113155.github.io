    <h1>My life story</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Deborah Igaba, born and raised in a town called Kampala found
        in Uganda. I lived in Kampala all my life until I moved to the United States 
        of America after my college early last year. I lived in Centreville,Virginia 
        for about a year and a half before I moved to Fairfeild, Iowa for school.
    </p>
    <p>
        Life in America has granted me lots of oppotunities in terms of career and 
        studies. More so, I have gotten to meet people from all parts of the world 
        with different cultures and backgrounds. I hope to use these oppotunities to
        give back to the community and restore hope in the lives of people around me
        through writing code.
